## Description
---
This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Test Driven Development (TDD). The Team Profile Generator is a command-line-input application from Node that generates a team profile based on a user's input with the module Inquirer from Node.js. Once prompted, the user will enter however many team members they desire. Once the user's team is complete, an html is generated to display the team using the FS module.
